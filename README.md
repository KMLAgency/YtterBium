YtterBium is an userscript to improve your experience with YouTube!

### Features
1. **Add** a new button on the playback control to toggle [PiP](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/picture-in-picture-chrome-extension) player *(Picture-in-Picture [API](https://wicg.github.io/picture-in-picture/) for Chrome allows you to watch videos in a sticky floating window (always on top of all other windows).* (I removed the one of the MiniPlayer (which will become obsolete anyway))!
2. Changed the theater mode to fill the whole window! *(hide the "NavBar", that will show again on scroll).*
